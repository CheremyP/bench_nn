# Bench-NN

This project aims to benchmark the speed of various neural network frameworks. By running a series of tests on different frameworks, we can compare their performance and identify the most efficient ones.

## Getting Started

To get started with Bench-NN, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/bench-nn.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the benchmark script: `python benchmark.py`

## Usage

The benchmark script allows you to specify the neural network frameworks you want to test and the specific models to evaluate. You can customize the number of iterations and other parameters to suit your needs.

```bash
python benchmark.py --frameworks tensorflow pytorch --models resnet50 densenet121 --iterations 100
```

## Results

After running the benchmark, the results will be displayed, showing the time taken by each framework to complete the specified models. This information can help you make informed decisions when choosing a neural network framework for your projects.
